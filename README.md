# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ReactJS)**: Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces.
  - *Advantages*: Offers component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability. Provides a virtual DOM for efficient rendering and performance optimization.
  - *Disadvantages*: Steep learning curve for beginners. May introduce overhead for small projects.

- **CSS (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)**: Styling frameworks for creating responsive and visually appealing web applications.
  - *Advantages*: Provides pre-designed components and utilities for faster development. Offers a responsive grid system for layout flexibility.
  - *Disadvantages*: Can lead to larger CSS file sizes and increased specificity. May require additional customization for unique design requirements.

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring web pages.
  - *Advantages*: Simple and intuitive syntax for defining the structure of web content.
  - *Disadvantages*: Limited interactivity and styling capabilities compared to JavaScript and CSS.

- **EmailJS**: Service for handling form submissions and sending emails from the client-side.
  - *Advantages*: Simplifies the process of integrating email functionality into web applications. Provides a secure and reliable email delivery service.
  - *Disadvantages*: Limited customization options compared to server-side email solutions. May require additional configuration for advanced use cases.

## To-Dos and Improvements

- Optimize rendering performance for better user experience, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex animations.
- Enhance accessibility features to ensure compatibility with screen readers and assistive technologies.
- Improve SEO by implementing meta tags, structured data, and other optimization techniques to increase visibility in search engine results.
- Conduct usability testing to gather feedback from users and identify areas for improvement in user interface design and functionality.
- Explore internationalization (i18n) to support multiple languages and localize content for a global audience.(working on it)
- here also better using a server approach like nodemailer and express to store sensitive data securilly as dotenv is not secure enough and sensitive data may be displayed through web dev tools for example
